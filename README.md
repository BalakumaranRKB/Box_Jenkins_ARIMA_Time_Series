# Box_Jenkins_ARIMA_Time_Series
The code written in the files other than Final_Box_Jenkins_ARIMA.py were done by Team 3 of CCE IISc Project.
As a part of the project, Team 6 has used the API's of Team 3 for calculations purposes like variance and co-variance.
The code in Final_Box_Jenkins_ARIMA.py was authored by me.
